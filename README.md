# Plotting-Covid-Data

## Goal
Simple introduction to data plotting, trying to teach myself how to work with data, visualize it and python specific libraries.
I am using the pandas library for data manipulation and data structures. The data is pulled from the "Our World in Data" (OWID)
Repository https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data. 
The plotting site of this project is done with matplotlib for visualizing the data.
